## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Provide an overview of the project, including its purpose, target audience, and any relevant background information.

## 2. Requirements<a name="requirements"></a>

List the functional and non-functional requirements for the project.


## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific features and capabilities that a software system must have to meet the intended use and purpose. Here are examples of functional requirements for a Python CLI program:

### 1. User Authentication
   - **Description:** The CLI program should support user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users must provide valid credentials (username and password) to log in. Unauthorized access attempts should be denied.

### 2. File Processing
   - **Description:** The CLI program should be able to read, write, and manipulate files on the local filesystem.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users should be able to specify input and output files as command-line arguments. The program must handle common file formats like text files and CSV files.

### 3. Data Validation
   - **Description:** The CLI program should validate user input to ensure that it meets specified criteria.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** If the user provides invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric value for a numeric parameter), the program should display an appropriate error message and prompt the user to provide valid input.

### 4. Data Filtering
   - **Description:** Users should be able to filter data based on specified criteria.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The program should allow users to use command-line options to filter data based on attributes such as date ranges, categories, or keywords.

### 5. Reporting
   - **Description:** The CLI program should generate reports based on processed data.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users should be able to request and generate reports using command-line options. The reports may be displayed on the console or saved to a specified file.

### 6. Batch Processing
   - **Description:** The CLI program should support batch processing of multiple files or data sets.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users should be able to provide a list of input files or directories as arguments, and the program should process them in sequence or in parallel.

### 7. Logging
   - **Description:** The CLI program should log relevant information for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The program should generate log files containing information about user actions, errors, and warnings.

### 8. Configuration
   - **Description:** Users should be able to configure the behavior of the CLI program through a configuration file.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The program should read settings from a configuration file, allowing users to customize parameters such as default directories, logging levels, or output formats.

### 9. Help and Documentation
   - **Description:** The CLI program should provide help messages and documentation to guide users.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users should be able to access help messages by using a `--help` option or similar. The help messages should provide information about available commands, options, and usage examples.

### 10. Interactive Mode
   - **Description:** The CLI program should support an interactive mode for users who prefer a more dynamic and iterative experience.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Users should have the option to launch the program in interactive mode, where they can enter commands and receive immediate feedback.

These examples cover a range of functionalities commonly found in CLI programs. Depending on the nature of your specific Python CLI program, you may have additional or different functional requirements.

## Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe the qualities or characteristics that define how a software system should perform, rather than specific behaviors or features. Here are examples of non-functional requirements for a Python CLI program:

### 1. Performance
   - **Response Time:** The CLI program should respond to user input within 2 seconds, ensuring a responsive user experience.
   - **Throughput:** The program should handle a minimum of 100 file processing operations per minute.

### 2. Scalability
   - **Scalability:** The program should be able to handle an increasing number of concurrent users without a significant decrease in performance.
   - **Data Volume:** It should support processing large files or datasets without a significant impact on response time.

### 3. Reliability
   - **Availability:** The CLI program should be available 99.9% of the time during standard operating hours.
   - **Fault Tolerance:** The program should gracefully handle unexpected errors and recover without data loss.

### 4. Security
   - **Authentication:** User authentication should use secure mechanisms (e.g., hashed passwords) to protect user credentials.
   - **Authorization:** Access to sensitive functionalities or data should be restricted based on user roles and permissions.

### 5. Usability
   - **User Interface Consistency:** The CLI program should have a consistent and intuitive command-line interface.
   - **Documentation:** The program should be well-documented, providing clear instructions on installation, configuration, and usage.

### 6. Maintainability
   - **Code Maintainability:** The source code should follow coding standards and be well-commented to facilitate future maintenance.
   - **Modularity:** The program should be designed with modular components to ease updates and modifications.

### 7. Compatibility
   - **Operating System Compatibility:** The CLI program should be compatible with major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - **Python Version:** The program should be compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

### 8. Performance Monitoring
   - **Logging:** The program should log performance metrics, errors, and warnings for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
   - **Alerting:** Alerts should be triggered for critical errors or performance degradation.

### 9. Portability
   - **Dependency Management:** The program should manage external dependencies effectively to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.
   - **Configuration Portability:** Configuration files should be portable between different installations.

### 10. Compliance
   - **Regulatory Compliance:** The CLI program should comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.
   - **License Compliance:** The program and its dependencies should adhere to open-source licenses.

### 11. Testability
   - **Unit Testing:** The code should be designed to facilitate unit testing, with a target coverage of 80% or above.
   - **Integration Testing:** The program should have a suite of integration tests covering key functionalities.

These non-functional requirements focus on aspects such as performance, reliability, security, usability, maintainability, compatibility, and compliance. Adjust and expand these requirements based on the specific needs and constraints of your Python CLI program.
